  about: >-
    We are presenting an electric car which we have been working on for over 2 years.
    For the last six months we have been working on a prototype on the basis of which a production car will be created.
  differences: "Key Differences"
  disadvantages: "Existing products disadvantages"
  printing_forms_complexity: >-
    The complexity of the manufacture of printing plates and the production
    of stamped steel parts for the body (requires about $500 million in investments).
  assembling_complexity: >-
    The complex process of welding and assembling these parts into the body
    requires large investments (about $400-500 million).
  body_protection: >-
    The need to protect the body from corrosion and varnishing. Cost about $100 million.
  our_solution: "Our Solution"
  no_monocoque: "No monocoque body"
  frame_space: >-
    We proposed to move away from the monocoque body
    and make a load-bearing aluminum frame using <b>frame-space</b> technology,
    on which the elements of the car body and other components will be installed.
    All costs for the production and equipment of the assembly line will not exceed $10-15 million,
    which will significantly reduce the cost of the car.
    Using existing production sites, costs can be reduced to $5-6 million.
  research: "Research"
  frame_space_research: >-
    According to research from the <b>German Aerospace Center at the University of Stuttgart</b>,
    thanks to the <b>spant-space-frame</b> design of the passenger compartment,
    cars will be more economical and safer in the future.
    <b>One of our employees was directly involved in this research.</b>
  design: "Design"
  body_made_of: >-
    The body elements are made of thermoplastic,
    which does not require varnishing and does not corrode.
    This allows to reduce production and maintenance costs by <b>1000 times</b>,
    which significantly affects the final cost of the car.
    Simultaneously, this improves the safety and comfort of the vehicle.
  batteries: >-
    We also propose to install solar panels with an area of 4.2m<sup>2</sup>,
    which will recharge the main battery and provide an additional 30-40 km per day,
    which in urban conditions will significantly affect the battery consumption and increase the mileage.
  power: "Power"
  batteries_install: >-
    The frame structure allows us to install a second battery in our car (at the request of the client).
    The volume of one battery is <b>30 kW/h</b>, which provides a car mileage on one charge up to <b>250 km</b>.
    When installing a second battery, the mileage increases to <b>500 km</b> on a single charge.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The weight of a car with one battery is <b>950 kg</b>, with two it is <b>1100 kg</b>.
  up_to_two_batteries: "Up to 2 batteries"
  inclusivity: "Inclusivity"
  accessibility: "Accessibility"
  accessibility_description: >-
    The car can be used by people with disabilities in wheelchairs.
    The gas and brake pedals for this category of persons will be moved from the foot area
    into the steering wheel area, and up to two persons in wheelchairs will be able to move comfortably in our electric vehicle.
    The wheelchair will be fixed with special devices while driving,
    which will maximally protect the driver and passengers.
  sizes: >-
    The car's interior has been designed taking into account modern requirements for comfort and safety.
    Also, a body modification system has been developed to increase the luggage volume.
    It can hold up to 3m<sup>3</sup> of payload! For comparison, the volume of the trunk of a BMW X7 with folded seats
    is 2m<sup>3</sup> with a length of 5.15m, and the length of our car is 4.05m.
    The distance between the rear and front seats is 1.15m,
    for comparison in Mercedes Maybach this distance is 1.05m.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The armrests and tabletop consoles retract to make room for loading luggage.

  safety: "Safety"
  safety_list: >-
    With its small size, our car has three levels of safety:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <span class="circled-number">&#9312;</span> Airbags for driver and passenger
    <br/>
    <span class="circled-number">&#9313;</span> Airbags for the car itself <b>(new technology)</b>
    <br/>
    <span class="circled-number">&#9314;</span> Airbags for pedestrians and cyclists
  safety_pedestrians: >-
    A very important point is the installation of airbags for the car and pedestrians.
    We have patented this technology and it will be used for the first time in road transport.
    Thanks to it, we increase safety for passengers, pedestrians and cyclists.
